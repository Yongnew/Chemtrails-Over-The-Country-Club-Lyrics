        <p>
            I slept last night in a good hotel<br>
            I went shopping today for jewels<br>
            The wind rushed around in the dirty town<br>
            And the children let out from their schools<br>
            I was standing on a noisy corner<br>
            Waiting for the walking green
        </p>
        <p>
            Across the street he stood<br>
            And he played real good<br>
            On his clarinet for free
        </p>
        <p>
            Now me I play for fortunes<br>
            And those velvet curtain calls<br>
            I got a black Limousine and two gentlemen<br>
            Who escort me through these halls<br>
            And I'll play if you've got the money<br>
            Or if you're a friend to me
        </p>
        <p>
            But the one man band<br>
            By the quick lunch stand<br>
            He's been playing real good for free
        </p>
        <p>
            Nobody stopped to hear him<br>
            Though he played so sweet and high<br>
            They knew he had never been on their TV<br>
            So they passed his music by<br>
            I meant to go over and ask for a song<br>
            Maybe put on a harmony<br>
            I heard his refrain<br>
            As the signal changed<br>
            He was playing real good for free
        </p>
