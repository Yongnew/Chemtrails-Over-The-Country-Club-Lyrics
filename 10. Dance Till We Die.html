            I'm coverin' Joni and dancin' with Joan<br>
            Stevie's callin' on the telephone<br>
            Cory almost burned down my home<br>
            But, God, it feels good not to be alone
        </p>
        <p>
            But sometimes this ranch feels like my only friend<br>
            And life doesn't always work out like we planned<br>
            We keep it movin', babe
        </p>
        <p>
            So we made it back in the middle of the night<br>
            To the Louisiana two-step high and bright<br>
            And we won't say when, we won't ask why<br>
            And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll keep walkin' on the sunny side<br>
            And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
        </p>
        <p>
            Troubled by my circumstance<br>
            Burdened by the weight of fame<br>
            Clementine's not just a fruit<br>
            It's my daughter's chosen name
        </p>
        <p>
            And when all the bars close down tonight<br>
            There's one that stays open just for us, alright<br>
            We keep dancin', babe
        </p>
        <p>
            And when all the bars close down tonight<br>
            There's one that stays open just for us, alright<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            So we made it back in the middle of the night<br>
            (We keep dancin', babe)<br>
            To the Louisiana two-step high and bright<br>
            (We keep movin', babe)<br>
            And we won't say when, we won't ask why<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            I went down to Woodside<br>
            I left Berkley, out of city, out of mind<br>
            Killin' it, talkin' shit<br>
            Joan said she was gonna quit<br>
            Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
        </p>
        <p>
            I left San Francisco, I've been coverin' Joni<br>
            And I'm dancin' with Joan<br>
            It's kinda hard to find love<br>
            When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone
        </p>
        <p>
            So we made it back in the middle of the night<br>
            (We keep movin', babe)<br>
            To the Louisiana two-step high and bright<br>
            (We keep dancin', babe)<br>
            And we won't say when, we won't ask why<br>
            We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side<br>
            And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die<br>
            And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
        </p>
