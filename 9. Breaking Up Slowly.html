            Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do<br>
            I love you only, but it's making me blue<br>
            So don't send me flowers like you always do<br>
            It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing
        </p>
        <p>
            Are these my good years or do I have none?<br>
            Are there really good years for everyone?<br>
            I don't wanna live with a life of regret<br>
            I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette
        </p>
        <p>
            'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do<br>
            I love you only, but it's making me blue<br>
            So don't send me flowers like you always do<br>
            It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do
        </p>

            George got arrested out on the lawn<br>
            We might be breaking up after this song<br>
            Will he still love me long after I'm gone?<br>
            Or did he see it coming all along?
        </p>

            'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do<br>
            I love you only, and it's making me blue<br>
            So don't send me flowers like you always do<br>
            It's hard to be lonely (baby, breaking up is hard to do)<br>
            Breaking up slowly (baby, breaking up is hard to do)<br>
            Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do<br>
            I love you only, and it's making me blue<br>
            So don't send me flowers like you always do<br>
            It's hard to be lonely<br>
