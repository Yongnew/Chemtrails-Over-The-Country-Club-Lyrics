            Seasons may change<br>
            But we won't change<br>
            Isn't it sweet, how we, know that already?<br>
            Winter to Spring<br>
            Spring back to Fall<br>
            Isn't it cool how nothing here changes at all?
        </p>
        <p>
            You make me feel I'm invincible<br>
            Just like I wanted<br>
            No more candle in the wind<br>
            It's not like I'm invisible<br>
            Not like before when I<br>
            Was burning at both ends
        </p>
        <p>
            We did it for fun, we did it for free<br>
            I did it for you, you did it for me<br>
            We did it for the right reasons<br>
            We did it for the right reasons
        </p>
        <p>
            Seasons may change<br>
            But we won't change<br>
            Isn't it strange how different we are from all of our friends?<br>
            Seasons will turn<br>
            The world it will turn<br>
            The only thing we'll turn, is the pages of all the poems we burn
        </p>
        <p>
            Honey, you make me feel I'm invincible<br>
            It's just like I wanted<br>
            No more candle in the wind<br>
            It's not like I'm invisible<br>
            Like I was before<br>
            No more burning at both ends
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I do it for fun, I do it for free<br>
            I do it for you, you do it for me<br>
            We did it for the right reasons<br>
            We did it for the right reasons
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember watching, How Green Was My Valley<br>
            Then I was thinking, "How deep was the canyon that you came from?"<br>
            Television static was quite overwhelming<br>
            Was it because of the cabin, the candles in the wind?
        </p>
        <p>
            We've done it for fun, we've done it for free<br>
            I showed up for you, you showed up for me<br>
            We did it for the right reasons<br>
            We did it for fun, we did it for free<br>
            When I was young 'til eternity<br>
            I'll do it for the right reasons<br>
            Withstanding all the time, changes and seasons
        </p>
        <p>
            Right reasons
        </p>
