            I come from a small town, how about you?<br>
            I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA<br>
            And I want you to come<br>
            Eighty miles North or South will do<br>
            I don't care where as long as you're with me<br>
            And I'm with you and you let me
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me love you like a woman<br>
            Let me hold you like a baby<br>
            Let me shine like a diamond<br>
            Let me be who I'm meant to be<br>
            Talk to me in poems and songs<br>
            Don't make me be bittersweet<br>
            Let me love you like a woman<br>
            Let me hold you like a baby<br>
            Let me hold you like a baby
        </p>
        <p>
            I come from a small town far away<br>
            I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA<br>
            And I want (need) you to come<br>
            I guess I could manage if you stay<br>
            It's just if you do I can't see myself having any fun, so
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me love you like a woman<br>
            Let me hold you like a baby<br>
            Let me shine like a diamond<br>
            Let me be who I'm meant to be<br>
            Talk to me in songs and poems<br>
            Don't make me be bittersweet<br>
            Let me love you like a woman<br>
            Take you to infinity<br>
            Let me love you like a woman (let me hold you like a baby)<br>
            Take you to infinity<br>
            Let me love you like a woman (let me hold you like a baby)<br>
            Take you to infinity
        </p>
        <p>
            We could get lost in the purple rain<br>
            Talk about the good old days<br>
            We could get high on some pink champagne<br>
            Baby, let me count the waves
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me love you like a woman<br>
            Let me hold you like a baby<br>
            Let me shine like a diamond<br>
            Let me be who I'm meant to be<br>
            Talk to me in songs and poems<br>
            Don't make me be bittersweet<br>
            Let me love you like a woman
