            "It's dark but just a game"<br>
            That's what he would say to me<br>
            The faces aren't the same<br>
            But their stories all end tragically
        </p>
        <p>
            Sweet, what-whatever, baby<br>
            And that's the price of fame<br>
            A tale as old as time, you'd be<br>
            Sweet, what-whatever, baby<br>
            A pretty little fool<br>
            To think exceptions to the rule<br>
            Just walk around<br>
            Like you and me this way
        </p>
        <p>
            But life is sweet, what-whatever, baby<br>
            You gotta take them for what they've got<br>
            And while the whole world is crazy<br>
            We're getting high in the parking lot
        </p>
        <p>
            We keep changing all the time<br>
            The best ones lost their minds<br>
            So I'm not gonna change<br>
            I'll stay the same<br>
            No rose left on the vines<br>
            Don't even want what's mine<br>
            Much less the fame<br>
            It's dark but just a game<br>
            It's dark but just a game
        </p>
        <p>
            It's dark but just a game<br>
            So play it like a symphony<br>
            You know our love's the same<br>
            They'll both go down in infamy
        </p>
        <p>
            I was a pretty little thing<br>
            Ain't got a lot to sing, but<br>
            Nothing came for me either one but pain<br>
            But fuck it
        </p>
        <p>
            Life is sweet, what-whatever, baby<br>
            Don't ever think it's not<br>
            While the whole world is crazy<br>
            We're making out in the parking lot
        </p>
        <p>
            We keep changing all the time<br>
            The best ones lost their minds<br>
            So I'm not gonna change<br>
            I'll stay the same<br>
            No rose left on the vines<br>
            Don't even want what's mine<br>
            Much less the fame<br>
            It's dark but just a game
        </p>
