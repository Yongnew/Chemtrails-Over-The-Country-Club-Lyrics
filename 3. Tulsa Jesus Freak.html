            You should stay real close to Jesus<br>
            Keep that bottle at your hand, my man<br>
            Find your way back to my bed again<br>
            Sing me like a Bible hymn<br>
            We should go back to Arkansas<br>
            Trade this body for that can of Gin<br>
            Like a little piece of heaven<br>
            No more candle in the wind
        </p>
        <p>
            You should come back to our place, baby<br>
            Don't be afraid of our love<br>
            On the second floor, darling<br>
            In the second flat, hurry up<br>
            'Cause down in Arkansas, the stores are all closed<br>
            The kids in their hoodies, they dance super slow<br>
            We're white-hot forever<br>
            And only God knows
        </p>
        <p>
            You should stay real close to Jesus<br>
            Keep that bottle at your hand, my man<br>
            Find your way back to my bed again<br>
            Sing me like a Bible hymn<br>
            We should go back to Arkansas<br>
            Trade this body for that can of Gin<br>
            Like a little piece of heaven<br>
            No more candle in the wind
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll be white-hot forever<br>
            We're white-hot forever<br>
            We'll be white-hot forever and ever and ever, amen
        </p>
        <p>
            Could I come back to the ranch, baby?<br>
            I had to get away for a while<br>
            Just to rest my nerves, darling<br>
            Can I make you laugh with a smile?<br>
            You knew when you chose me<br>
            I was nothing but ordinary<br>
            And now the wind's blowing<br>
            Reminding you of what you know
        </p>
        <p>
            You should stay real close to Jesus<br>
            Keep that bottle at your hand, my man<br>

        <p>
            We'll be white-hot forever<br>
            White-hot forever<br>
            White-hot forever and ever and ever, the end<br>
            White-hot forever<br>
            White-hot forever<br>
            White-hot forever and ever and ever, amen
        </p>
        <p>
            You should stay real close to Jesus<br>
            (If you don't pray, you'll never learn)<br>
            (You know what I'm saying?) find your way back to my bed again<br>
            Sing me like a Bible hymn<br>
            We should go back to Arkansas (I like living here)<br>
            Trade this body for that can of Gin<br>
            Like a little piece of heaven<br>
            No more candle in the wind
