            I've been wearing the same damn clothes for three damn days<br>
            Lincoln, Nebraska's got me in a haze<br>
            The thing about men like you<br>
            Is you got a lot to say<br>
            But will you stay?
        </p>
        <p>
            You say you got my name on your tattoo<br>
            Opening up doors, pulling out chairs, look at you<br>
            You talk to God like I do<br>
            I think you know<br>
            The same secrets that I do<br>
            I'm talking 'bout
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all those who wander are lost<br>
            Not all those who wander are lost<br>
            Not all those who wander<br>
            All those who wander<br>
            All those who wander are lost<br>
            It's just wanderlust
        </p>
        <p>
            The thing about being on the road<br>
            Is there's too much time to think<br>
            About seasons of old<br>
            As you pour yourself a drink<br>
            'Cause every time I said no<br>
            It wasn't quite what I meaned<br>
            If you know what I mean
        </p>
        <p>
            You say you got my name as your tattoo<br>
            Pulling out chairs, opening doors, look at you<br>
            You talk to people like I do<br>
            I think you know the same things that I do
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all those who wander are lost<br>
            Not all those who wander are lost<br>
            Not all those who wander<br>
            All those who wander<br>
            All those who wander are lost<br>
            It's just wanderlust
        </p>
        <p>
            Look at me and look at you<br>
            Look at what you made me do<br>
            Look at me and look at you<br>
            Bible on your tattoo<br>
            Look at me and look at you<br>
            Look at what you made me do<br>
            Look at me and look at you
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all those who wander are lost<br>
            Not all those who wander are lost<br>
            Not all those who wander<br>
