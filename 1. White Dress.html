            Sun stare, don't care with my head in my hands thinking of a simpler time<br>
            Like Sun Ra, feel small, but I had it under control every time
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was a waitress wearing a white dress<br>
            Look how I do this, look how I got this<br>
            I was a waitress working the night shift<br>
            You were my man, felt like I got this<br>
            Down at the Men in Music Business Conference<br>
            Down in Orlando, I was only 19<br>
            Down at the Men in Music Business Conference<br>
            I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene<br>
            And I felt seen<br>
            Mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh, mhm
        </p>
        <p>
            Summer, sizzling<br>
            Listening to jazz out on the lawn<br>
            Listening to White Stripes when they were white-hot<br>
            Listening to rock, all day long
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress, handling the heat<br>
            I wasn't famous, just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat<br>
            Like, look at how I got this<br>
            Look how I got this, just singing in the street<br>
            Down at the Men in Music Business Conference<br>
            I felt free 'cause I was only 19<br>
            Such a scene
        </p>
        <p>
            Summer, summer's almost gone<br>
            We were talking about life, we were sitting outside 'til dawn<br>
            But I would still go back<br>
            If I could do it all again, I'd fly<br>
            Because it made me feel, made me feel like a god<br>
            'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god<br>
            Somehow it made me feel, made me feel like a god
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was a waitress wearing a white dress<br>
            Look how I do this, look how I got this<br>
            I was a waitress working the night shift<br>
            You were my man, felt like I got this<br>
            Down at the Men in Music Business Conference<br>

            And I felt seen<br>

        <p>
            When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress<br>
            Like, look how I do it, look how I got this<br>
            I was a waitress wearing a tight dress<br>
            Like, look who would do this, look who would got this
        </p>
        <p>
            It made me feel, made me feel like a god<br>
            It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off<br>
            'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god<br>
            Kinda makes me feel like maybe I was better off
