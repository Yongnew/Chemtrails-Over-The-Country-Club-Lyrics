            I'm on the run with you, my sweet love<br>
            There's nothing wrong contemplating God<br>
            Under the chemtrails over the country club<br>
            Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool<br>
            Me and my sister just playing it cool<br>
            Under the chemtrails over the country club
        </p>
        <p>
            Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels<br>
            Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools<br>
            Baby, what's your sign?<br>
            My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun<br>
            You won't play, you're no fun<br>
            Well, I don't care what they think<br>
            Drag racing my little red sports car<br>
            I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm on the run with you, my sweet love<br>
            There's nothing wrong contemplating God<br>
            Under the chemtrails over the country club<br>
            Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool<br>
            Me and my sister just playing it cool<br>
            Under the chemtrails over the country club
        </p>
        <p>
            Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools<br>
            We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool<br>
            It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me<br>
            I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild
        </p>
        <p>
            You're in the wind, I'm in the water<br>
            Nobody's son, nobody's daughter<br>
            Watching the chemtrails over the country club<br>
            Suburbia, The Brentwood Market<br>
            What to do next? Maybe we'll love it<br>
            White picket chemtrails over the country club
        </p>
        <p>
            My love, my love
        </p>
        <p>
            Washing my hair, doing the laundry<br>
            Late-night TV, I want you only<br>
            Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs<br>
            It's never too late, baby, so don't give up<br>
            It's never too late, baby, so don't give up<br>
            Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (you're born in December and I'm born in June)<br>
            You're born in December and I'm born in June (under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah)
        </p>
        <p>
            My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon<br>
            My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon
