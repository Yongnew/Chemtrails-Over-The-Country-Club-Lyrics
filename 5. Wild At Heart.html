            What would you do if I told you, you make me crazy<br>
            To see your pretty pics on Sunset Boulevard?<br>
            And it makes me lazy, so I smoke cigarettes<br>
            Just to understand the smog
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you lots, like polka-dots<br>
            You're killing me more<br>
            Than coffee pots and Insta dots<br>
            With every drop I pour<br>
            And if I had to do it all<br>
            Again I would because, babe, in the end<br>
            It brought me here to you
        </p>
        <p>
            I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes<br>
            Ran into the dark<br>
            And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart<br>
            The cameras had flashes, they caused the car crashes<br>
            But I'm not a star<br>
            If you love me, you'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart<br>
            If they love me, they'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
        </p>
        <p>
            What would you do<br>
            If I wouldn't sing for them no more?<br>
            Like if you heard I was out in the bars drinking Jack and Coke<br>
            Goin' crazy for anyone who would listen to my stories, babe?<br>
            Time after time, I think about leaving<br>
            But you know that I never do, just 'cause you keep me believing
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you lots, despite the odds<br>
            You're killing me, Joe<br>
            And all these thoughts brought us apart<br>
            And that's okay, too<br>
            'Cause even in the worst of times<br>
            You saw the best of me<br>
            And that's why I stay here with you
        </p>
        <p>
            I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes<br>
            Ran into the dark<br>
            And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart<br>
            The cameras had flashes, they caused the car crashes<br>
            But I'm not a star<br>
            If you love me, you'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart<br>
            If you love me, you'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
        </p>
        <p>
            'Cause, baby, I'm wild at heart<br>
            If you love me, you'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild at heart<br>
            Baby, I'm wild, wild at heart<br>
            If they love me, they'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart<br>
            If they love me, they'll love me<br>
            'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
        </p>
